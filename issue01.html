                <div class="horizontal-scroll__item">
                    <div>For the first ten years of my career, I worked for Massimo Vignelli, a designer who is
                        legendary for using a very limited number of typefaces. Between 1980 and 1990, most of my
                        projects were set in five fonts: <i>Helvetica</i> (naturally), <i>Futura</i>, <i>Garamond No.
                            3</i>, <i>Century Expanded</i>, and, of course, <i>Bodoni</i>.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="horizontal-scroll__item">
                    <div>For Massimo, this was an ideological choice, an ethical imperative. "In the new computer age,"
                        he once wrote, "the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level of
                        visual pollution threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few
                        basic ones, and trash the rest." For me, it became a time-saving device. Why spend hours
                        choosing between <i>Bembo</i>, <i>Sabon</i> and <i>Garamond No. 3</i> every time you needed a
                        Venetian Roman? For most people — my mom, for instance — these were distinctions without
                        differences. Why not just commit to <i>Garamond No. 3</i> and never think about it again? My
                        Catholic school education must have well prepared me for this kind of moral clarity. I accepted
                        it gratefully.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="horizontal-scroll__item">Then, after a decade, I left my first job. Suddenly I could use any
                    typeface I wanted, and I went nuts. On one of my first projects, I used 37 different fonts on 16
                    pages. My wife, who had attended Catholic school herself, found this all too familiar. She
                    remembered classmates who had switched to public school after eight years under the nuns: freed at
                    last from demure plaid uniforms, they wore the shortest skirts they could find. "Jesus," she said,
                    looking at one of my multiple font demolition derbies. "You've become a real slut, haven't you?"
                </div>
                <div class="horizontal-scroll__item">It was true. Liberated from monogamy, I became typographically
                    promiscuous. I have since, I think, learned to modulate my behavior — like any substance abuser, I
                    learned that binges are time-consuming, costly, and ultimately counterproductive — but I've never
                    gone back to five-typeface sobriety. Those thousands of typefaces are still out there, but my
                    recovery has required that I become more discriminating and come up with some answers to this
                    seemingly simple question: why choose a particular typeface? Here are thirteen reasons.

                    <div>Some typefaces are just perfect for certain things. I've specified exotic fonts for identity
                        programs that work beautifully in headlines and even in text, but sooner or later you have to
                        set that really tiny type at the bottom of the business reply card. This is what <i>Franklin
                            Gothic</i>
                        is for. Careful, though: some typefaces work too well. <i>Frutiger</i> has been used so much for
                        signage programs in hospitals and airports that seeing it now makes me feel that I'm about to
                        get diagnosed with a brain tumor or miss the 7:00 to O'Hare.

                    <div>
                        I’ve heard of several projects where the designer found a font that was created the same year
                        the client’s organization was founded. This must give the recommendation an aura of manifest
                        destiny that is positively irresistible. I haven’t had that luck yet, but still try to find the
                        same kind of evocative alignment. For instance, I was never a fan of Aldo
                        Novarese’s<i>Eurostyle</i>, but I came to love it while working on a monograph on Eero Saarinen:
                        they both share an expressiveness peculiar to the postwar optimism of the 1950’s.

                    <div>Once I saw a project in a student portfolio that undertook the dubious challenge of redesigning
                        the Tiffany’s identity. I particularly disliked the font that was used, and I politely asked
                        what it was. “Oh,” came the enthusiastic response, “that’s the best part! It’s called
                        <i>Tiffany</i>!” On the other hand, Bruce Mau designed Spectacle, the book he created with David
                        Rockwell, using the typeface <i>Rockwell</i>. I thought this was funny.

                    <div>Once I was working on a project where the client group included some very strong-minded
                        architects. I picked <i>Cheltenham</i>, an idiosyncratic typeface that was not only well-suited
                        to the project's requirements, but was one of the few I know that was designed by an architect,
                        Bertram Goodhue. Recently, I designed a publications program for a girls' school. I used a
                        typeface that was designed by a woman and named after another, Zuzana Licko's <i>Mrs. Eaves</i>.
                        In both cases, my clients knew that the public would be completely unaware of the story behind
                        the font selection, but took some comfort in it nonetheless. I did too.

                    <h3>5. Because it was there.</h3>
                    <div>Sometimes a typeface is already living on the premises when you show up, and it just seems mean
                        to evict it. "We use <i>Baskerville</i> and <i>Univers 65</i> on all our materials, but feel
                        free to make an alternate suggestion." Really? Why bother? It's like one of those shows where
                        the amateur chef is given a turnip, a bag of flour, a leg of lamb and some maple syrup and told
                        to make a dish out of it. Sometimes it's something you've never used before, which makes it even
                        more fun.

                        Krone decided to use <i>Futura</i> in Doyle Dane Bernbach's advertising for Volkswagen, and they
                        still

                        based the logo on <i>Bookman Swash Italic</i>, a typeface I found unimaginably dated and ugly.
                        But Glaser's logo had replaced an earlier one by Peter Palazzo that was based on <i>Caslon
                            Italic</i>. I proposed we return to <i>Caslon</i>, and distinctly remember saying, "<i>Bookman
                            Swash Italic</i> is always going to look ugly." The other day, I saw something in the office
                        that really caught my eye. It was set in <i>Bookman Swash Italic</i>, and it looked great. Ugly,
                        but great.

                        Anything but a boring typeface, he felt, got in the way of the ideas. We settled on <i>Trade
                            Gothic</i>.

                        with Matthew Carter and Chester. It is the ultimate indulgence, but well worth the extra effort.
                        Is this proliferation? I say bring it on.

                    <div>Sometimes I think that Massimo Vignelli may be using too many typefaces, not too few. A true
                        fundamentalist requires a monotheistic worldview: one world, one typeface. The designers at
                        Experimental Jetset have made the case for <i>Helvetica</i>. My partner Abbott Miller had a
                        period of life he calls "The <i>Scala</i> Years" when he used that typeface almost exclusively.
                        When the time is right, I might make that kind of commitment myself.

                        which first appeared here on Design Observer. I wanted it to feel like a real book for readers —
                        it has no pictures — so I asked Abbott to design it. He suggested we set each one of the 79
                        pieces in a different typeface. I loved this idea, but wasn't sure how far he'd want to go with
                        it. "What about the one called 'I Hate <i>ITC Garamond</i>?'" I asked him. "Would we set it in
                        <i>ITC Garamond</i>?" He looked at me as if I was crazy. "Of course," he said.

                <p id="item1" style="grid-column: 1/3;">He may be 81 years old, with a career spanning 60 years and
                    counting, but Karel Martens is
                    still of
                    the mindset that his work can always be better. It’s what drives the self-professed workaholic, he
                    tells us over a video call, and it’s the reason he’s updated his historic monograph several times.
                    Originally published back in 1996, the monograph was an instant classic in its extensive survey of
                    the prolific graphic designer’s career. As well as co-founding the two-year master’s programme at
                    Werkplaats Typografie, with Wigger Bierma in Arnhem, Karel, a central figure in the Dutch modernist
                    movement, seems to have designed it all. Throughout his impressive career he has turned his hand to
                    stamps, coins and films – not to mention every other graphic design staple, from books to corporate
                    identities.
                </p>
                <p id="item2" style="grid-column: 3/5;">Flicking through his monographs provides a tireless flow of
                    inspiration, including most
                    recently the
                    one published on the cusp of 2020 by Roma Publications. Featuring an open Japanese bind and
                    double-sheeted spreads, this most recent monograph is different to its predecessors for its play
                    with borders, as Karel puts it, an interesting area “where two worlds meet”. A philosophical
                    interpretation for someone more renowned for their technical, more specifically typographic
                    precision. Beyond this distinction with borders, however, which Karel has designed “as close to the
                    edge as possible”, and beyond the visual impressiveness of each comprehensive spread, Re-Printed
                    Matter remains resolute in its detail and beauty. It’s also a testament to Karel Martens’ unyielding
                    and ever-curious approach to creativity.
                </p>
                <p id="item3" style="grid-column: 5/7;">Karel could have easily developed an ego, so it’s refreshing to
                    hear someone of his
                    stature freely
                    admit that “sometimes you still make the same old stupid mistakes.” It’s this criticality that
                    drives him to keep making work, but that also on the flip side prevents him from looking back at old
                    projects with nostalgia. For him, mistakes give rise to unexpected surprises, especially those made
                    on the computer, a technology established decades into his career. “It can be a nice surprise or not
                    so nice a surprise,” he says, “but by making mistakes, sometimes you feel like, wow, where did that
                    come from?”
                </p>
                <div class="spacer"></div>
                <p id="item4" style="grid-row: 4/5; grid-column: 3/5;">
                    There is nothing negative associated with the mistake for Karel. It may be a cliché, but the proof
                    is in the pudding. He’s someone who views no difference between artist and designer (just the label)
                    and through his unique way of seeing, creativity is “all about the person”. By this, he means that
                    creativity is the antithesis of dogma. Making work is “all about trying and discovering” and in his
                    opinion, “there are no truths.” He uses the example of a garden. When creating a garden, the common
                    law dictates that the big plants go at the end and the small ones in front. But what if the other
                    way around is more interesting?
                </p>
                <p id="item5" style="grid-row: 4/5; grid-column: 5/7;">
                    Famous for his sense of experimentation, there are countless projects we could cite now to
                    demonstrate the Dutch master’s way of thinking. We’ll just mention a few that helped cement his
                    reputation for type and print: the design of OASE Journal for Architecture, where Karel explores the
                    relationship between graphic design and architecture, a role he took up in 1990; his well-known
                    symbol generated cloud images, formed by the tight repetition of intricately designed rosettes; and
                    perhaps most infamously, his ongoing work with the Stedelijk’s print collection where he repurposes
                    old archive cards to become diplomas for Werkplaats Typografie graduates.
                </p>
                <p id="item6" style="grid-row: 4/5; grid-column: 7/9;">
                    The list of Karel’s defining projects could go on for a while, and after all, it’s why the monogram
                    exists in multiple iterations. But it’s his lesser-known works that are potentially the most
                    interesting, as they show a different side to the accomplished designer. His experimental film Not
                    For Resale, for instance, shows exactly how a blunder can propel one’s creativity forward. The
                    conversation around the film began as we discussed the development of technology. “How relevant is
                    the latest technology to your work and teachings?” I asked him. “It’s always relevant,” he replied,
                    and hinted to the inundation of new techniques influencing the design canon, adding to the process
                    of experimentation.

                <p id="item7" style="grid-column: 1/3;">“I am from the generation where the computer came to us later in
                    life, even though it’s
                    not that long ago in historical terms. But I am thinking it’s not for me, it’s for the new
                    generations. There is a lot of knowledge that I don’t understand,” he says. </p>
                <p id="item8" style="grid-column: 4/6;">To process this, he made a movie, a way for him to do something
                    with the experience. At
                    the time, he was working on a university lecture and as he always does, he pinned reference images
                    on the wall as an “extension of memory”, an archive of sorts. Karel’s daughter – who incidentally is
                    also a graphic designer – took pictures of the wall, every ten centimetres to make into presentation
                    slides. And after the lecture, a pupil asked to have a copy of the slides, which for Karel, meant
                    using a scanner for the first time.</p>
                <p id="item9" style="grid-column: 7/9;">“So I started making scans of the slides and it ended up being
                    the wrong resolution, the
                    wrong cropping,” he says. </p>
                <p id="item10" style="grid-row: 2/3 ;grid-column: 2/4;">When those first attempts at scans landed on
                    Karel’s computer’s desktop, it was “a mess”
                    – as he puts it, “full of shit, full of the wrong things”. </p>
                <p id="item11" style="grid-row: 2/3 ;grid-column: 6/8;">With help from a technician at the computer lab,
                    hundreds of Karel’s scans suddenly came
                    to life as they were organised in a folder. </p>
                <div class="spacer"></div>
                <img id="artigo2img7" src="assets/imgs/a2img7.png" alt=# style="width: 40vw; left: 30vw;">

            <div id="part4">
                <p id="item12" style="grid-row: 1/2; grid-column: 1/3;">“Let me make a movie out of it,” he thought, as
                    he imagined the scans as frames, edited together in an ordered sequence. “It was exciting. And it
                    was also done with new technology.”</p>
                <p id="item13" style="grid-row: 2/3; grid-column: 2/4;">Karel isn’t afraid of stepping out his comfort
                    zone, no matter what stage of life. His ability to introduce a new medium by looking at an image
                    from a different angle is just one of the many reasons why his portfolio to date is so diverse. When
                    Karel first launched his career after studying fine art at the Arnhem Academy of Art and Industrial
                    Arts in 1961, the industry was completely different to the screen-based discipline it is today. Back
                    then, he would hand draw type as small as point sizes eight or nine. A far cry from the
                    technological simplicity of today, when you hit a button and a letter appears before you.</p>
                <p id="item14" style="grid-row: 1/2; grid-column: 4/6;">For Karel, however, the latter process is more
                    difficult. “I discovered everything through reflecting. There can be a lot of rules in the game,” he
                    says on the act of designing, “but you have to order them and kind of sort them out. I think
                    limitation is an important thing.”</p>
                <p id="item15" style="grid-row: 3/4; grid-column: 5/7;">Present technology erases many of the
                    limitations that were present in the pre-Adobe design era. But for Karel, it’s imperative to
                    remember that graphic design was born out of restriction; restriction of what the hands can do with
                    print. So the fundamentals of the art remain much the same for this new era. The process of graphic
                    design can be boiled down to this question posed by Karel: </p>
                <p id="item16" style="grid-row: 2/3; grid-column: 7/9; align-self: end;">“How many different elements do
                    you need to tell
                    the story?”</p>
                <p id="item17" style="grid-row: 3/4; grid-column: 7/9;">The story doesn’t have to be 100 per cent
                    accurate, though. The designer can “lie a bit” or cut corners in the information they hold back from
                    the viewer. That’s also part of the script – don’t tell the total story so the viewer can hook onto
                    the missing details. In graphic design, the work is outward-facing, for the public.</p>
                <div class="spacer"></div>
            </div>
            <div id="part5">
                <p id="item18" style="grid-row: 1/2; grid-column: 1/3; align-self: end;">In some ways, the aim is to
                    engage them and make
                    them feel part of a story mid-climax. As Karel puts it more broadly: “Curiosity is a very important
                    thing for a human being. If you see a book on the shelf, you should become curious. Absence in
                    design is very important, the things you don’t see. But designers can offer a set of ingredients and
                    allude to certain things.”</p>
                <p id="item19" style="grid-row: 1/2; grid-column: 3/5; align-self: end;">With so many options readily
                    available nowadays
                    at the click of a button, in Karel’s opinions, a design can feel “too complete”. After all, the
                    computer is mimicking something that was first crafted by the human hand. He expands on this notion
                    of over-completeness: “Too many colours, too many shapes, too many ideas. It is harder but more
                    important to take a small part of [a design] and make it clear as a kind of hesitation, or
                    suggestion.”</p>
                <img id="artigo2img8" src="assets/imgs/a2img8.png" alt=# style="width: 46vw; left: 2vw;">

                <p id="item20" style="grid-row: 1/2; grid-column: 1/3; align-self: end;">Arguably, what Karel is
                    describing is the result of our Instagram-centric design scene today, a medium which calls for
                    instant gratification as you scroll through your feed. In turn, this can lead to an overload of
                    visual stimuli where all the answers are seemingly in one place. By comparison, when Karel started
                    out his career in what he calls “the classical time”, design called for, literally, a more measured
                    approach.</p>
                <p id="item21" style="grid-row: 1/2; grid-column: 3/5; align-self: end;">To create a beautiful piece of
                    work, the designer had to centre the text, align the capitals, space each glyph perfectly and so on,
                    all by hand. Of course, doing this on the computer also requires a lot of creative expression and
                    aesthetic sensibility, but it’s a different set of skills. Some could say that modern technology has
                    made the designer “lazier”, but on the other hand, for Karel, it doesn’t make sense to go back to
                    analogue methods. What we have today works for a reason. The past has been done.</p>
                <p id="item22" style="grid-row: 1/2; grid-column: 5/7; align-self: end;">In this way, says Karel, “it’s
                    surprising that people are still making classical typefaces.” It would go against his belief in
                    modernism to say otherwise; a school of thought he is famous for and which, above all, embraces the
                    new. Though he makes astute comparisons on how different the industry’s processes are today, he does
                    not claim a preference for one over the other, and respects the creative values of the time.
                    Instead, he merely offers his observations in relation to his own experiences. Like this one: “It’s
                    stupid to make a book in a way that nobody can make anymore. It’s passé, it may be beautiful and
                    it’s still beautiful if it’s repeated. But after the second or third time, I believe you should
                    start something new.”</p>

                <p id="item23" style="grid-row: 1/2; grid-column: 1/3; align-self: end;">While Karel duly acknowledges
                    that tradition is important, he also points out the necessity of criticality. A designer can still
                    be part of a long tradition while questioning their purpose or process at the same time. Why should
                    something change? If a laborious, drawn-out process no longer offers benefits in its efficiency,
                    economy or concept, then what is it a stylistic expression of? “For me,” says Karel, “that’s the
                    starting point or a kind of measurement.”</p>
                <p id="item24" style="grid-row: 1/2; grid-column: 3/5; align-self: end;">He takes the example of the
                    colour black; an undying staple in design. In terms of Eurocentric design history, however, the
                    colour black, in principle, originates from the bible. It was used as a representation of the human
                    voice where there was no reason to give it a colour. Today, “it’s important to have that knowledge
                    in history, so some people can form an argument to change it.” All that being said, as he pointed
                    out later on in a conversation about how designers often play with distinctions, “When all the world
                    is in colour, a black-and-white movie is a relief.”</p>
                <p id="item25" style="grid-row: 1/2; grid-column: 5/7; align-self: end;">He’s just as much a teacher as
                    he is a designer in the field. And this is where his remarkable breadth of knowledge comes in handy.
                    Confident in his own opinions and values, as a teacher, Karel prefers to guide students rather than
                    “teach them things” in the definitive sense. It’s a philosophy Werkplaats Typografie was founded on:
                    to guide. If he sees a student who is always making the same kind of thing, perhaps avoiding a
                    certain element of their practice, Karel will say “why not, that’s one of the qualities of your
                    voice. Nice voices don’t necessarily have to be perfect.”</p>
                <p id="item26" style="grid-row: 1/2; grid-column: 7/9; align-self: end;">Teaching is “a kind of broad
                    way of gaining information,” he says, explaining that learning is a two-way street between pupil and
                    professor. Every autumn (with the exception of 2020, given the pandemic), Karel usually journeys to
                    New York to lecture at Yale School of Art. He notes the multiculturalism of the student population –
                    people from all over the world, from differing cultures and backgrounds too. And when such a
                    wide-ranging group gathers together in one place, “you can learn a lot.” It goes back to his
                    quintessential view that curiosity is key, as now, for a man who has done so many wonderful things
                    and inspired so many people, he concludes: </p>
